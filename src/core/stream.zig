//! Streaming CSV over a `std.Io.Reader`, plus an auto-selecting facade that
//! picks between slurp-into-memory and streaming based on input size.
//!
//! Streaming model: the 0.16 `Reader` already maintains a sliding window
//! (`buffer` / `seek` / `end`). We process the largest prefix of the window that
//! consists of *whole records*, in one batched `forEachField` pass (so SIMD
//! amortizes over many records, not one), then `toss` that prefix and let the
//! reader refill. Because we only ever consume up to a record boundary, every
//! refill begins outside any quoted region — so no quote state has to cross a
//! refill, only a re-scan of the small leftover partial record.
//!
//! Field lifetime: fields handed to the callback are valid only for the duration
//! of that call (the reader buffer is reused on the next refill). This matches
//! every streaming CSV reader (Go's `ReuseRecord`, etc.).
//!
//! Like the SIMD parser, streaming assumes RFC 4180-strict quoting. The window
//! must be larger than the longest record; a record that fills the entire window
//! with no terminator yields `error.RecordTooLong`.
